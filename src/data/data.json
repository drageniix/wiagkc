Together the main ethnic groups represented include Indigenous Peoples, Africans, Indians, Europeans, Chinese and Portuguese. The Community is multi-lingual; with English as the major language complemented by French and Dutch and variations of these, as well as African and Indian expressions. The Full and Associate States make up approximately 16 million citizens, 60% of whom are under the age of 30. Great strides have been made by collaborating, particularly through functional cooperation in education, in health, in culture, and in security.
